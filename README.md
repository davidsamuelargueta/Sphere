# Spheres in Higher Dimensions
Aftering watching a short video on spheres in higher dimensions from the Physics Youtube Channel, @Tibees, I decided to use Jupyter Notebook to showcase this phenomenon. I created a function to represent the volume of a sphere as the recursive formula I saw in the video and in my short research on the subject, to explore the relationship of the volume of a sphere with a radius of 1 as the number of dimensions, n, increases to higher dimensions which was then showcased with a plot using matplotlib.
